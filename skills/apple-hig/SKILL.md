# apple-hig

Make a frontend's **interaction, components, and patterns** genuinely satisfy Apple's Human
Interface Guidelines (HIG) — most often a **web** surface (web app, blog, dashboard, agent/chat
UI), and also native Apple platforms when asked. HIG is written in points, gestures, and SF
Symbols; this skill keeps the *intent* of each rule and **translates it to HTML/CSS/ARIA** so a
web UI feels native-quality without pretending to be a native app.

This is a **focused reference + review** skill. It does not draw charts/figures, does not cover
Android/Material Design, and does not write backend logic.

## How this skill loads (progressive disclosure)

1. **Always read the "Non-negotiables" below first** — they hold for every Apple-quality UI.
2. **Identify the target surface**: web (default) vs. a specific native platform. Web rules map
   through [references/web-mapping.md](references/web-mapping.md).
3. **Scan the task for the topic**, then open the matching reference via
   [references/routing-index.md](references/routing-index.md) (keyword → file + official Apple URL).
   Read only the file(s) you need.
4. **Answer with the rule + the concrete mapping** (e.g. "≥44×44 pt → `min-height/min-width: 44px`"),
   and cite the official HIG page from the routing index for anything beyond this bundle.
5. **For "is my UI compliant?" requests**, switch to Review mode (below). Done means every reported
   finding states the HIG rule, the violated location, and the concrete web/native fix.

## The HIG mindset (apply before any specific rule)

- **Clarity** — legible text at every size, precise icons, generous negative space; content is
  the focus, chrome recedes.
- **Deference** — UI helps people understand and interact with content, never competes with it;
  prefer translucency/blur and restrained color over heavy decoration.
- **Depth** — distinct visual layers and purposeful motion convey hierarchy and give feedback;
  transitions explain where things came from and where they go.
- **Consistency** — reuse standard components and platform conventions so behavior is predictable;
  surprise is a cost, not a feature.

## Non-negotiables (tier-1, always true)

These are the rules a HIG-quality UI must not break, with their web mapping:

- **Hit targets ≥ 44×44 pt.** Every tappable/clickable control. Web: `min-height:44px;min-width:44px`
  (or padding to reach it); keep ≥8px between adjacent targets.
- **Type stays legible and scalable.** Use the system font stack; never ship body text below ~11 pt
  (≈15–17 px on web for body). Web: `font: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "SF Pro Text", "Segoe UI",
  Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif`; size in `rem` and honor the user's font size — never disable zoom.
- **Contrast ≥ 4.5:1** for normal text, ≥3:1 for large text/UI glyphs. Never encode meaning by
  **color alone** — pair with text, icon, or shape.
- **Respect system preferences.** Dark mode → `prefers-color-scheme`; reduced motion →
  `prefers-reduced-motion` (drop/replace non-essential animation); increased contrast →
  `prefers-contrast`. These are requirements, not enhancements.
- **Every control has all its states.** default · hover (pointer) · focus (visible ring) · active/pressed ·
  disabled · loading · selected. A focus state that is invisible is a bug. Web: never `outline:none`
  without an equally-visible replacement.
- **Feedback is immediate and proportional.** Acknowledge every action within ~100 ms (state change,
  spinner, or haptic on native). Destructive/irreversible actions need confirmation or undo.
- **Motion has purpose and an off switch.** Use motion to show hierarchy and continuity, keep it short
  (~200–350 ms), ease in/out, and gate it behind `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **One primary action per view.** Make the preferred choice visually dominant; demote or remove the rest.
- **Standard components over custom.** Reach for the platform/standard control first; only build custom
  when a standard one genuinely can't express the need — then make it behave like the standard.

## Interaction · Components · Patterns (the core)

This skill's weight is here. Open the file that matches the task:

- **Interaction** → [references/interaction.md](references/interaction.md): touch targets, gestures →
  pointer/keyboard, focus order, control states, feedback & haptics, transitions/motion.
- **Components** → [references/components.md](references/components.md): navigation bar, tab bar, buttons,
  lists/tables, sheets, alerts & action sheets, forms & text fields, pickers/toggles/sliders/steppers,
  search, menus, segmented controls — anatomy, behavior, web equivalent, do/don't.
- **Patterns** → [references/patterns.md](references/patterns.md): navigation (hierarchical/flat/modal),
  modality & dismissal, onboarding, loading/empty/error states, search, settings, data entry,
  undo & confirmation, multitasking/adaptivity.
- **Foundations (supporting)** → [references/foundations.md](references/foundations.md): color, typography,
  layout/spacing, materials/vibrancy, dark mode, accessibility, icons (and why SF Symbols are not
  redistributable for web).
- **Per-platform deltas** → [references/platforms.md](references/platforms.md): how Web/PWA, iOS, iPadOS,
  macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS differ on the same component/pattern.

## Web translation, in one line each

Full table in [references/web-mapping.md](references/web-mapping.md). The high-frequency ones:

| HIG concept | Web realization |
| --- | --- |
| 44 pt hit target | `min-height:44px; min-width:44px` + spacing |
| SF Pro / Dynamic Type | system font stack + `rem` sizing, respect user zoom |
| Reduce Motion | `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` |
| Dark Mode | `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` + semantic CSS vars |
| Materials / vibrancy | `backdrop-filter: blur()` with a solid fallback |
| VoiceOver | semantic HTML first, ARIA only to fill gaps |
| Sheet / modal | `<dialog>` or focus-trapped overlay, swipe/Esc to dismiss |
| Haptic feedback | visual/state feedback on web (no Taptic); never rely on it |
| SF Symbols | use a comparable web icon set — SF Symbols are not licensed for web |

## Review mode — "is my UI HIG-compliant?"

When asked to audit/grade an existing frontend:

1. Run the mechanical pass: `scripts/hig_audit.py` flags high-signal, machine-checkable violations
   (sub-44px targets, `outline:none` without replacement, missing `prefers-reduced-motion` /
   `prefers-color-scheme`, non-system fonts, color-only state). It cannot judge layout, semantics,
   or copy — treat it as a smoke test, not a verdict.

   ```bash
   uv run apple-hig/scripts/hig_audit.py path/to/src            # scan a dir
   uv run apple-hig/scripts/hig_audit.py styles.css index.html  # or specific files
   ```

2. Do the judgment pass with [references/review-checklist.md](references/review-checklist.md) —
   walk interaction → components → patterns → foundations and report each finding as
   **rule → where it's violated → the fix (with the web mapping)**, citing the official HIG page.

3. Summarize as a short scorecard (pass / needs-work per area) plus the prioritized fixes. Done
   means the mechanical findings and judgment findings are reconciled, not reported as separate truths.
